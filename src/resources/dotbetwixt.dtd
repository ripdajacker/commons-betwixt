          Represents an element in the xml.
          An element may be mapped to properties of the bean
          (when it has a property attribute)
          or it can be purely structure (when it does not)

          the updater attribute can be used
          (in conjunction with the property attribute) to specify a custom update
          method.

          the (optional) class attribute specifies an implementation class that should
          be used for instantiation (as opposed to the type of the property)

          Note that name is required except when the property is a collective
