<section name="Getting Started">
    <p>
    Probably the best way to get started is to look at some examples. 
    <a href='examples.html#simple-example'>Here</a> is some simple example code that reads and writes a bean (together
    with some comments). It's a good place to start. 
    </p>
</section>

<section name="Mapping beans to XML">

    <p>There are various ways of mapping beans to an XML structure. For example 
    consider a simple bean</p>
    
<source><![CDATA[public class CustomerBean {
    public String getName();
    public Order[] getOrders();
    public String[] getEmailAddresses();
}]]></source>
    
    <p>This could be mapped to XML in various ways. 
    A couple of examples of these different ways follow.</p>


<subsection name="Example 1">
    
    <p>This example uses attributes for primitive types.</p>

<source><![CDATA[<CustomerBean name='James'>
    <order id='1'>...</order>
    <order id='2'>...</order>
    <emailAddress>jstrachan@apache.org</emailAddress>
</CustomerBean>]]></source>
</subsection>
    
    
    <subsection name="Example 2">
    
    <p>This example uses elements for all properties and wraps collections in an 
    extra element (which can be quite common in XML schemas). Also note that some 
    element names have been changed.</p>
    
<source><![CDATA[<customer>
    <name>James</name>
    <orders>
        <order id='1'>...</order>
        <order id='2'>...</order>
    </orders>
    <email-addresses>
        <email-address>jstrachan@apache.org</email-address>
    </email-addresses>
</customer>    ]]></source>
    
    <p>Betwixt aims to provide a diversity of possible mappings such that the 
    developer can choose, if they wish, how their beans appear as XML to support 
    whatever XML encoding scheme that is desired. If no particular mapping is 
    provided then Betwixt will create a default mapping for you. Also the 
    customization mechanism allows you to just override the parts you want to and 
    let Betwixt default the rest. So if you just want to rename a property in XML 
    for a certain type, thats all you need to do. No need to hand-code what Betwixt 
    can deduce for itself. </p>

<section name="Customizing the mapping of a bean to XML (basic)">
    
<subsection name=".betwixt files">

    <p>The XMLIntrospector will look for files of the form <i>className.betwixt</i> 
    on the classpath using the same ClassLoader used to load the given class and use 
    that document to specify the mapping to XML. If this file does not exist 
    then the default introspection rules are used. (Note that there are also various
    more advanced ways to vary this rule. For more details see 
    <a href='binding.html#Multi%20Mapping'>multi mapping</a> for more details)</p>
    <p>The simplest possible file may just set the name of the element. e.g.</p>
    
<source><![CDATA[<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
<info>
<element name='channel'/>
<addDefaults/>
</info>]]></source>
    
    <p>The above means to use the name 'channel' for the outer most element for the 
    given type. The <code>&lt;addDefaults&gt;</code> means to add the defaults from the introspector. 
    This allows you to just rename a few properties then let the introspector do the 
    rest. There is also a <code>&lt;hide&gt;</code> element which allows one or more properties to be 
    hidden. Also note that the <code>&lt;element&gt;</code> and 
    <code>&lt;attribute&gt;</code> tags can be nested to any 
    kind of depth allowing whatever XML structure you wish. This can be useful if 
    you wish to wrap collections in some arbitrary collection tags or to group 
    properties of a bean together in some XML structure. e.g.</p>
    
<source><![CDATA[<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
<info primitiveTypes='attribute'>
<hide property='something'/>
<element name='channel'/>
    <element name='customerList'>
    <element name='customer' property='customers'/>
    </element>
    <element name='foo'>
    <attribute name='qqq' property='ppp'/>
    <element name='bar' property='xyz'/>
    <addDefaults/>
</element>
</info>
]]></source>
    
    <p>Note that the <code>.betwixt</code> file specifies the mapping for a single bean.
    So, whilst you can add extra elements (as above), it can't be used to specify 
    to names for child beans through nesting <code>element</code> elements.</p>
    
    <p>The primitiveTypes attribute in the <code>&lt;info&gt;</code> element is 
    optional and can be used to specify whether primitive java types (strings, numbers, dates etc) are 
    specified as attributes or elements by default.</p>
    <p>Finally static text can be specified using a value attribute inside an 
    <code>&lt;element&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;attribute&gt;</code> tag. 
    e.g. to add constant attributes such as a version label to the 
    generated XML...</p>
    
<source><![CDATA[<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
<info primitiveTypes='element'>
<element name='rss'/>
    <attribute name='version' value='0.91'/>
    <element name='channel'/>
    <addDefaults/>
</element>
</info>
]]></source>

	<p>The plain <code>&lt;addDefaults&gt;</code> tag adds default properties
	and the adders (it can find) for all the properties (both explicitly 
	described in the <code>.betwixt</code> file and the default ones discovered).
	Usually, this is really pretty useful but sometimes more finely grained
	control is needed. In this case, there are two properties that can be set
	to given this extra control:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong><code>add-properties</code></strong> If this property is set to any value
		other than <code>true</code> the discovery of default properties will
		be suppressed.</li>
		<li><strong><code>add-adders</code></strong> if this property is set to
		any value other than <code>true</code> the matching of adders will be suppressed.</li>
		<li><strong><code>guess-name</code></strong> if this property is set to
		any value other than <code>true</code> the guessing of names for elements without a name attribute
    will be suppressed. Note that this may need to be set to <code>false</code> when mapping mixed
    collections.
    By default, Betwixt will guess names.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Using <code>&lt;addDefaults add-properties='false' add-adders='false'/&gt;</code>
	doesn't really make any sense but no error will be thrown.</p>
