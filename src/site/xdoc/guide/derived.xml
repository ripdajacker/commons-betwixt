        <subsection name='What Is A Derived Bean?'>
            <p>
A derived bean is one whose runtime class differs from the mapped property type
(as determined during introspection).

        <subsection name='Using An Attribute To Specify Class'>
            <p>
An easy way to specify the class to be loaded is for the class name to be 
specified by an xml attribute. By default, the <code>className</code> attribute
(if present) is assumed to contain the name of the class to be loaded. 
        </p>
            <p>
For example the following xml:
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
    <Animals> 
        <animal className='org.apache.commons.betwixt.io.read.FerretBean'> 
            <call>Dook</call>
            <colour>albino</colour> 
            <latinName>Mustela putoris furo</latinName>
            <name>Lector</name> 
        </animal> 
        <animal className='org.apache.commons.betwixt.io.read.CatBean'> 
            <call>Meow</call>
            <colour>black</colour> 
            <latinName>Felis catus</latinName>
            <name>Sam</name> 
        </animal> 
        <animal className='org.apache.commons.betwixt.io.read.DogBean'> 
            <breed>mongrol</breed>
            <call>Woof</call>
            <latinName>Canis familiaris</latinName> 
            <name>Bobby</name>
            <pedigree>false</pedigree> 
        </animal> 
    </Animals>
]]>

            <p>
will construct objects of type <code>FerretBean</code>, <code>CatBean</code> and 
<code>DogBean</code>.
        </p>
            <p>
The attribute which contains the fully qualified class name can be configured through
the <code>classNameAttribute</code> property of the <code>BindingConfiguration</code>.
        </p>
            <p>
The classname mapping is implemented by a <code>ChainedBeanCreator</code>. If this
feature is not required, a custom bean creation chain should be used.
        </p>
    </subsection>
        <subsection name='Mapping An Element To A Class Name'>
            <p>
A common variation on the above occurs when the java and the xml should be decoupled.
So, no attributes with class names permitted. A common use case requires that different
elements are associated with different types of bean. For example:  
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
    <animals> 
        <ferret> 
            <call>Dook</call>
            <colour>albino</colour> 
            <latinName>Mustela putoris furo</latinName>
            <name>Lector</name> 
        </ferret> 
        <cat> 
            <call>Meow</call>
            <colour>black</colour> 
            <latinName>Felis catus</latinName>
            <name>Sam</name> 
        </cat> 
        <dog> 
            <breed>mongrol</breed>
            <call>Woof</call>
            <latinName>Canis familiaris</latinName> 
            <name>Bobby</name>
            <pedigree>false</pedigree> 
        </dog> 
    </animals>

          <p>
To read this xml, the class corresponding to each element must be known.
Of course, this is a <a href='binding.html#Mixed%20Collections%20-%20Guessing%20Element%20Names'>mixed collection</a>
and so needs to be mapped as such. Then a suitable <a href='reading.html#Reading%20Polymorphic%20Mappings'>polymophoric
mapping</a> needs to be created. For example:
      </p>
<source><![CDATA[
<betwixt-config>
  <class name='org.apache.commons.betwixt.io.read.Animals'>
    <element name='animals'>
<!--
Note that an adder must be set but addDefaults will add a name
(and so prevent a polymorphic mapping) and so should be avoided.
-->
      <element property='animals' updater='addAnimal'/>
    </element>
  </class>
  <class name='org.apache.commons.betwixt.io.read.FerretBean'>
    <element name='ferret'>
      <addDefaults/>
    </element>
  </class>
  <class name='org.apache.commons.betwixt.io.read.CatBean'>
    <element name='cat'>
      <addDefaults/>
    </element>
  </class>
  <class name='org.apache.commons.betwixt.io.read.DogBean'>
    <element name='dog'>
      <addDefaults/>
    </element>
  </class>
</betwixt-config>
]]>
</source>
          <p>
This <a href='binding.html#Multi%20Mapping'>multi mapping</a> should be registered with
the <code>XMLIntrospector</code> before the beans are written or read. For example (read):
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
   BeanReader reader = new BeanReader();
   ...
   reader.getXMLIntrospector().register(new InputSource(new StringReader(MAPPING)));
   reader.registerBeanClass(Animals.class);
   Animals animals = (Animals) reader.parse(in);

    <section name='Mapping Derived Beans'>
        <subsection name="Bind Time Type Verses Introspection Time Type">
            <p>
The introspection time type is the (expected) type as discovered during introspection.
The bind time type is the actual type of the object found as Betwixt runs. For example,
a property might have type <code>Animal</code> but when the getter of that property is 
called, the object returned might be a subclass (if <code>Animal</code> is a class) 
or an implementation (if <code>Animal</code> is an interface) - <code>Cat</code>, say.
In this case, <code>Animal</code> would be the introspection time type but <code>Cat</code>
the bind time type.
        </p>
            <p>
There are two approaches to deal with this situation: either the object can be mapped 
on the basis of it's bind time type (the actual class of the object) or on the basis
of it's introspection time type. In the first case, all the properties present will be 
mapped, in the second only a subset.
        </p>    
            <p>
For example, say that <code>Animal</code> has properties <code>latinName</code>
and <code>call</code> and that <code>Cat</code> is a subclass with an additional
<code>colour</code> property. Consider a bean with a property returning an <code>Animal</code>.
If the introspection time type is used, only the <code>latinName</code>
and <code>call</code> properties of a<code>Cat</code> bean will be read and written
whereas when bind time typing is used, all properties will be.
        </p>
            <p>
There are typical use cases which demonstrate the need for each approach. Betwixt 
supports both in a flexible way, for both reading and writing but defaults to 
bind time typing (which is typically more intuitive).
        </p>
    </subsection>
        <subsection name='Configuring Mapping Derivation'>
            <p>
Whether the bind time type or the introspection time type should determine the mapping
is configurable in two different ways. The <code>MappingDerivationStrategy</code> 
implementation set on the introspection configuration allows powerful but course-grained
control over which types of property should have their mappings determine in which ways.
Per-element control is also available through the dot betwixt document. This is typically
used for more finely grained refinements. The dot betwixt settings override the strategy.
        </p>
            <p>
For example, the following code snippet configures an <code>XMLIntrospector</code> 
so that (unless overridden by a dot betwixt document setting), introspection time types
will determine the mapping:
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
        XMLIntrospector xmlIntrospector = ...;
        xmlIntrospector.getConfiguration()
            .setMappingDerivationStrategy(
                MappingDerivationStrategy.USE_INTROSPECTION_TIME_TYPE);
}	
]]></source>
            <p>
The optional <code>mappingDerivation</code> attribute on an <code>&lt;element&gt;</code> element.
This attribute takes two enumerated values: <code>bind</code> and <code>introspection</code>.
As might be expected, <code>bind</code> indicates that the element should use 
the bind time type whereas <code>introspection</code> indicates that the introspection time
type should be used.
        </p>
            <p>
For example, when the following dot betwixt document is used, the <code>pet</code>
property's mapping will be determined by the introspection time type mapping.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
    <?xml version='1.0'?>
    <info>
        <element name='pet-record'>
            <element name='pet' property='pet' mappingDerivation='introspection'/>" +
        </element>
    </info>"
}	
]]></source>

            <p>
Note that the mapping derivations are added together with all of the other defaults
and so all elements without the <code>mappingDerivation</code> attribute will
default to bind time typing unless and <code>addDefaults</code> is present.
        </p>
    </subsection>

<section name='Default Mapping For Collections Implementations'>
	<p>
The default mapping for a collection is the one created automatically
by Betwixt. This is controlled by a number of general configuration settings.
For some classes (including <code>Collection</code> implementations)
special rules are applied. For collection implementations, these special
rules ensure that the contents are written and polymorphism is supported
for reading.
	</p>
	<p>
For example, suppose <code>AlphaList extends ArrayList</code>. It usually
contains <code>BetaBean</code>'s and <code>GammaBean</code>'s. Use a 
<a href='binding.html#Multi Mapping Document Format'>multi-mapping</a> contain
mappings for just <code>BetaBean</code> and <code>GammaBean</code> and not
<code>AlphaList</code>. This will force the default mapping to be used. 
When reading, <code>AlphaList</code> should be registered after the 
multimapping thus:
	</p>
<source><![CDATA[
	BeanReader reader = ...
	...
	reader.registerMultiMapping(...);
    reader.registerBeanClass(AlphaList.class);
