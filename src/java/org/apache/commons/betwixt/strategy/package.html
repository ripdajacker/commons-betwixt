  <p>This package contains a variety of plugin Strategy patterns that can be used to customize the
  default behaviour.of the XMLIntrospector
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Implementations of the <code>NameMapper</code> interface can be used to set the strategy used by 
  <code>XMLIntrospector</code> to determine how to convert bean and property names into element 
  and attribute names.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Implementations of the <code>PluralStemmer</code> interface allows the strategy used by 
  <code>XMLIntrospector</code> to find which plural method maps to a singular property name.
  This strategy is used to match composite properties to adder-methods.
  How plurals are constructed is langauge-dependent. A typical usage for custom strategies
  is to provide support for plural patterns in different languages.
