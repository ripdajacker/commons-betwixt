<body>

<p>This package is home to <code>IDGenerator</code> implementations.
</p>

<p><code>Betwixt</code> can generate <code>ID</code> and <code>IDREF</code>
    attributes for the elements it creates.
    By setting the IDGenerator property on the bean writer, a user can customize
    the algorithm used to generate these id's.
</p>

<p>
    This package contains the standard implementations of <code>IDGenerator</code>
    that ship with <code>Betwixt</code>.
    Users who want to create their own implementations can use these classes
    as examples.
