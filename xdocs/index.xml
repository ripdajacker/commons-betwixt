<section name="Betwixt : turning beans into XML">


<p>
   The Betwixt library provides an XML introspection mechanism
   for mapping beans to XML in a flexible way. It is implemented using an 
   XMLIntrospector and XMLBeanInfo classes which are similar to the standard 
   Introspector and BeanInfo from the Java Beans specification.</p>
<p>
   Betwixt provides a way of turning beans into XML as well as automatically 
   generating digester rules in a way that can be customized on a per type 
   manner in the same way that the BeanInfo mechanism can be used to customize 
   the default introspection on a java object.</p>
