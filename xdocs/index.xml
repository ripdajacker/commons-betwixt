<section name="Commons Betwixt : Turning beans into XML">


<p>
   The Betwixt library provides an XML introspection mechanism
   for mapping beans to XML in a flexible way. It is implemented using an 
   XMLIntrospector and XMLBeanInfo classes which are similar to the standard 
   Introspector and BeanInfo from the Java Beans specification.</p>
<p>
   Betwixt provides a way of turning beans into XML as well as automatically 
   generating digester rules in a way that can be customized on a per type 
   manner in the same way that the BeanInfo mechanism can be used to customize 
   the default introspection on a java object.</p>

<section name="Releases">
  <subsection name="Betwixt 0.5">
    <p>
Betwixt release 0.5 is currently in preparation. This is intended to consolidate
the Alpha 1 codebase for those users who want or need an official release of this
code. This numbering system more accurately reflects the current state of the codebase
- stable, mature but limited with APIs that will need to change.
    </p>
    <p>
The current CVS HEAD code now contains the merged refactoring branch. A 
baseline 0.6 release is planned for this code once 0.5 has been released.
    </p>

<section name="Nightly Builds">
    <p>
        Nightly builds are built once a day from the current CVS HEAD.
        This is (nearly) the lastest code and so should be treated with caution!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can get the nightly builds from 
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-commons/nightly/commons-betwixt/">here</a>
