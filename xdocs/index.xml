<section name="Commons Betwixt : Turning beans into XML">


<p>
   The Betwixt library provides an XML introspection mechanism
   for mapping beans to XML in a flexible way. It is implemented using an 
   XMLIntrospector and XMLBeanInfo classes which are similar to the standard 
   Introspector and BeanInfo from the Java Beans specification.</p>
<p>
   Betwixt provides a way of turning beans into XML as well as automatically 
   generating digester rules in a way that can be customized on a per type 
   manner in the same way that the BeanInfo mechanism can be used to customize 
   the default introspection on a java object.</p>

<section name="Releases">
  <subsection name='Betwixt 0.6'>
    <p>
Betwixt release 0.6 is the first release containing the refactored codebase 
featuring an improved design. This is a service release for those who have been
using the code from the CVS branch and offers an easy, compatible upgrade path
for those using the 0.5 design. It is recommended that all users should upgrade
to this release since the 0.5 design is no longer actively supported and is 
limited in terms of functionality. 
    </p>
    <p>
This release is binary compatible with the 0.5 codebase but the methods deprecated
in 0.5 are likely to be removed soon after 0.6 is released.
    </p>
    <p>
Betwixt release 0.6 is available in 
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.cgi#commons-betwixt'>binary</a>
and
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/site/sourceindex.cgi#commons-betwixt'>source</a>
distribution.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection name="Betwixt 0.5">
    <p>
Betwixt release 0.5 is intended to consolidate the codebase released as 1.0 Alpha 1. 
It is a service release for those users who want or need an official release of this 
codebase. This numbering system more accurately reflects the current state of the codebase 
- stable, mature but limited with APIs that may be subject to change in future releases. 
It is unlikely that active ASF development will continue for this released codebase 
since further development efforts are already focussed on newer designs.
    </p>
    <p>
The current CVS HEAD code now contains the merged refactoring branch. A 
baseline 0.6 release is planned for this code once 0.5 has been released.

<section name="Nightly Builds">
    <p>
        Nightly builds are built once a day from the current CVS HEAD.
        This is (nearly) the lastest code and so should be treated with caution!
    </p>

        You can get the nightly builds from
