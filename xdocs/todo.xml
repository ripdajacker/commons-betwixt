        The following is a list of items that need to be completed in
        Betwixt.  Contributions are welcome! 
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
		  Currently betwixt causes digester to output a warning '[WARN] Digester - -Empty stack (returning null)'.
		  We should patch the way betwixt uses digester to avoid this warning message.
		</li>
        <li>
		  Consider allowing the parsing of XML to order the properties/elements in the XMLBeanInfo
		  so that when the XML is output again it follows the same XML ordering again.
		  There is an example describing this 
		  <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=commons-dev@jakarta.apache.org&amp;msgNo=8488">here</a>
		</li>
        <li>
		  Create a SAXWriter class in the io package that takes a bean and writes to a SAX ContentHandler
		  rather that outputting textual XML like BeanWriter does.
		  This will allow Betwixt to work nicely in XML pipelining environments like Cocoon and Jelly.
		</li>
        <li>
		  Improved documentation! Improve package level documentation so that new developers can get up 
          to speed more quickly. Ensure all betwixt features have good user documentation. 
          More good code examples.
        </li>
        <li>
		  Create a W3C DOM implementation that acts as a facade on top of beans to allow beans to 
		  be transformed in XSLT engines as XML.
		</li>
       </ul>
