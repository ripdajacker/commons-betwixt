        The following is a list of items that need to be completed in
        Betwixt.  Contributions are welcome!.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
		  Create a SAXWriter class in the io package that takes a bean and writes to a SAX ContentHandler
		  rather that outputting textual XML like BeanWriter does.
		  This will allow Betwixt to work nicely in XML pipelining environments like Cocoon and Jelly.
		</li>
        <li>
		  Create a W3C DOM implementation that acts as a facade on top of beans to allow beans to 
		  be transformed in XSLT engines as XML.
		</li>
	  </ul>
