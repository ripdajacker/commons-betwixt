        <p>
<a href='http://cocoon.apache.org/'>Cocoon</a> is a web development framework (and more)
built around component pipelines and XML. A transformer is available for Cocoon which 
allows Betwixt to be plugged into these pipelines.
See the <a href='http://wiki.cocoondev.org/Wiki.jsp?page=BetwixtTransformer'>CocoonWiki</a> 
for documentation and example.
