<section name='Outputing Results (Of Bean Writing)'>
        <p>
Betwixt is flexible when it comes to outputing the results of bean writing.
The abstract <code>AbstractBeanWriter</code> class provides a basic framework
with an implementation API inspired by <a href='http://www.saxproject.org/'>SAX</a>.
Betwixt ships with writers that support SAX and textual streams
but others can be created with relative ease.
    </p>
</section>
<section name='Pushing Results to a Textual Stream'>
        <p>
<code>BeanWriter</code> push results to a textual stream. This can be used
to efficiently push content through a socket or just to create a simple String.
Note that only document fragments are created so you may need to append any
prologs before writing the bean.
    </p>
        <subsection name='Rendering Empty Tags'>
            <p>
Empty tags (ones containing no body content and no child nodes) can be rendered 
in two ways: as a single closed tag (for example <code>&lt;element/&gt;</code>) or as a 
pair of tags (<code>&lt;element&gt;&lt;/element&gt;</code>). By default, Betwixt
renders empty tags as a single close tag but setting the <code>BeanWriter</code>
<code>endTagForEmptyElement</code> to true will ensures that all empty elements are 
rendered as a pair of tags. For example:
        </p>
<source>
        BeanWriter writer = new BeanWriter(out);
        writer.setEndTagForEmptyElement(true);
</source>
    </subsection>
        <subsection name='Content Encoding'>
            <p>
When writing character data (the content between markup tags) to a textual stream,
sections of character data can be processed in various ways by Betwixt with the
aim of easily producing valid xml from beans. In particular, Betwixt assumes that
bean's property values are plain java rather than pre-processed xml and so
may contain characters that should be escaped.
        </p>
            <p>
There are two primary use cases for this processing: 
        </p>
            <ul>    
                <li>
Escaping the character data
            </li>
                <li>
Wrapping the entire section as <code>CDATA</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
            <p>
Betwixt provides a plug-in 
<a href='../apidocs/org/apache/commons/betwixt/strategy/MixedContentEncodingStrategy.html'>
MixedCharacterEncodingStrategy</a>
and a property on
<a href='../apidocs/org/apache/commons/betwixt/io/BeanWriter.html'>BeanWriter</a>
which allows the processing to be varied.
Factory constants are provided on <code>MixedCharacterEncodingStrategy</code>
for the two common use cases above.
        </p>
            <p>
For example, to have all content wrapped in <code>CDATA</code> sections:
        </p>
<source>
        BeanWriter writer = ... 
        writer.setMixedContentEncodingStrategy(MixedContentEncodingStrategy.CDATA);
</source>
            <p>
By default, Betwixt uses character escaping only. However, the default
strategy also supports per-property specification through
setting the appropriate <a href='binding.html#Using%20Options'>option</a>.
Setting the <code>org.apache.commons.betwixt.mixed-content-encoding</code>
option to <code>CDATA</code> will instruct the default strategy to wrap
the element's body text in a CDATA section.
For example, the following betwixt file fragment encodes the 
<code>some-property</code> element's body text as CDATA
(when the default strategy is used):
        </p>
<source>
<![CDATA[
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<info primitiveTypes="attribute">
	<element name='some-bean'>
        ...
		<element name='some-property' property='someProperty'>
			<option>
				<name>org.apache.commons.betwixt.mixed-content-encoding</name>
				<value>CDATA</value>
			</option>
		</element>
        ...
	</element>
</info>
]]>
</source>
    </subsection>
</section>
<section name='Pushing Results to SAX'>
        <p>
<code>SAXBeanWriter</code> push results to a SAX content handler. 
This allows Betwixt to efficiently participate as a content generator
in SAX-based pipelines such as <a href='http://cocoon.apache.org/'>cocoon</a>.
