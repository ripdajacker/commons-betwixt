            <p>
A <strong>DynaBean</strong> is a pseudo-bean whose properties may differ between instances of the same Class.
Pseudo-introspection of the available properties uses a pseudo-class of type DynaClass.
For more details see <a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils.html'>BeanUtils</a>.
                </p>
            <p>
Betwixt now supports the (correct) writing of objects implementating DynaBean. Rather than using standard
introspection for these objects, <code>Betwixt</code> now interrogates the DynaClass. Using .betwixt files
with DynaBeans is not yet supported and special behaviour of DynaBeans can be overridden by specifying a 
.betwixt file.
