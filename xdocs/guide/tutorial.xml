        <p>
This is a simple step-by-step <code>Betwixt</code> tutorial focussing 
on creating a mapping for an RSS 0.91 application. 
    </p>
    
<subsection name='The Object Model'>
        <p>
<code>Betwixt</code> is a dynamic, start-from-java XML-object binder.
For those unfamilar with these terms, this means that it maps XML &lt;-&gt; objects 
defining a binding from an existing group of java objects into xml (and back again)
without the use of code generation.
    </p>
        <p>
So, the place we'll start is with an 
<a href=
'http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/package-summary.html'>
object model</a> for 
RSS 0.91. This was originally created for 
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/digester/index.html'>Digester</a> 
by Craig R. McClanahan and Ted Husted with a few ammendments for this tutorial.
There are only four main objects in the model: 
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/Channel.html'>
Channel</a>
        </li>
            <li>
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/Image.html'>
Image</a>
        </li>
            <li>
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/Item.html'>
Item</a>
        </li>
            <li>
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/TextInput.html'>
TextInput</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
        <p>
The 
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/RSSApplication.html'>
application</a> simply processes an xml file in RSS format and creates a plain text version.
This isn't really very useful but is a good demonstration of bean reading.

    <subsection name='The XML'>
        <p>
RSS 0.91 is an XML vocabulary for describing metadata about websites commonly used
to supply news channels. RSS 0.91 is a little elderly and has quite a simple 
- but elegant - DTD:

        <p>
Since <code>Betwixt</code> is start-from-java, a DTD is not required.
This has many advantages during prototyping but this tutorial will
concentrate on a target specified by DTD (since it's a little more instructive).
What's probably needed in both cases is a good understanding of the xml
that the object model maps to.
    </p>
</subsection>
    
    <subsection name='Mapping Channel and Image'>
        <p>
Every xml document has a root node. 
Every <code>Betwixt</code> mapping starts from a root object.
The process of creating a mapping between the xml document and the object model
in <code>Betwixt</code> typically begins by working out the structural relationship
between the elements in the xml and the objects in the property subgraph of that root object.
    </p>
        <p>
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/Channel.html'>
Channel</a> is the root object mapping to the <code>&lt;channel&gt;</code> root element
of the xml. There are several ways that a mapping for an object can be defined in 
<code>Betwixt</code>. In this case, a <code>.betwixt</code> xml file will be used.
This following file is built into the jar in the package containing <code>Channel</code>:
    </p>
<source>
<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<info primitiveTypes="element">
  <element name="rss">
    <attribute name="version" property="version"/>
    <element name="channel">
      <element name="title"  property="title"/>
      <element name="item"  property="items"/>
      <element name="textinput"  property="textInput"/>
      <element name="skipDays">
        <element name="day" property="skipDays"/>
      </element>
      <element name="skipHours">
        <element name="hour" property="skipHours"/>
      </element>
      <addDefaults/>
    </element>
  </element>
</info>
]]>
</source>
        <p>
This describes how elements and attributes in the xml are mapped to properties
in a Channel object. <code>Betwixt</code> uses the type of the properties to
determine how to map the sub-graph under an element mapped to a property. 
So, for example the <code>textInput</code> property gets and sets a <code>TextInput</code>
object so the mapping for <code>TextInput</code> is used.
    </p>
        <p>
There are a number of collective properties: those that are mapped to a many 
objects (rather than just one). For example, the 
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/Channel.html#96'>items</a>
property is backed by an <code>List</code> and is mapped to zero, one or more <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> tags.
<code>Betwixt</code> looks for an adder method (something like <code>addItem</code>) which matches
the collective property (which should return something like a Collection) 
and uses that to add instances of the object created from the xml contained.
This mechanism can be customized but the defaults are fine in this case.
The standard mapping for the class contained with the collection is used.
    </p>
        <p>
Notice the <code>&lt;addDefaults/&gt;</code> tag. This tells <code>Betwixt</code>
to use it's introspection system to automagically determine the mappings
for all other properties. <code>Betwixt</code> has a number of powerful
strategy plugins which allow the introspection process to be controlled
in a finely-grained manner but in this case, the default mappings of the
remaining properties work fine :)
    </p>
        <p>
See 
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/guide/binding.html'>binding</a>
for more details.
    </p>
        <p>
Image uses a smaller <code>.betwixt</code> file:
    </p>
<source>
<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<info primitiveTypes="element">
  <element name="image">
    <element name="url" property="URL"/>
    <addDefaults/>
  </element>
</info>
]]>
</source>
</subsection>    
    <subsection name='Mapping Item and TextInput'>    
        <p>
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/Item.html'>Item</a>
is an example of the other (main) way that mappings are created for objects.
There is no <code>.betwixt</code> file so <code>Betwixt</code> introspects the 
class using reflection and determines a mapping based on the current introspector 
configuration. In this case, it's exactly what's required so there's no need to change
    </p>
        <p>
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/TextInput.html'>TextInput</a>
is also mapped by using introspection.
    </p>
</subsection>

    <subsection name='Reading A Bean From XML'>
        <p>
<code>org.apache.commons.betwixt.io.BeanReader</code> reads beans from xml documents.
The 
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/RSSApplication.html'>
tutorial application</a> reads an xml file (specified on the command line) 
and prints a plain text version. The root object (in this case <code>Channel</code>) 
needs to be 
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/RSSApplication.html#104'>
registered</a> first. Then 
<a href='http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/betwixt/xref-test/org/apache/commons/betwixt/examples/rss/RSSApplication.html#112'>
parse</a> can be used to parse an XML document and produce a bean.
