The Apache Wiki is a Wiki run by Apache for the Apache community. The Betwixt Wiki home page is

      The Werken Company runs an IRC server with a permenant Betwixt channel. 
      (Thanks <a href='http://blogs.werken.com/people/bob/'>Bob</a>!)
      </p>
      <p>
      To access the IRC server, point an appropriate IRC client at:
      </p>
      
      <source>
             server: irc.werken.com
               port: 6667
            channel: #betwixt
      </source>
      
      <p>
      For those who use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, here's a 
      <a href="irc://irc.werken.com:6667/#betwixt">quick link to #betwixt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Most business is still conducted on the commons-dev mailing list. (And so it should be!)
      But project members find IRC useful to roll around ideas, discuss designs - or just hang out.
      You're welcome to join us.
