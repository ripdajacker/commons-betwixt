    <subsection name='Primitives'>
        <p>
Betwixt used to analyse the bound class type at mapping time.
Those regarded as primitives were recognized and a different
mapping algorithm used. 
        </p>
        <p>
This is inefficient and also leads to greater complexity in the
mapping algorithm. Primitives should be recognized at introspection
time and the Descriptors produced should reflect these changes.        
        </p>
        <p>
The first work should be to change how the primitive mapping to 
elements works. The introspector should recognize primitives
at Introspection time and create an appropriate ElementDescriptor
containing a TextDescriptor with an appropriate Updator.
This updator should be called in the same way as any other.

    <subsection name='Mapping Collectives'>
    	<p>
This means mapping such collectives as Maps and Collections.   	
    	</p>
    	<p>
Previously, this has been done through special algorithms at
binding time. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
In particular, the isWrapCollectionsInElement needs to be 
decrepated and all calls removed.    	
    	</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Hollow Elements'>
		<p>
A hollow element is an element which is one that is mapped
to the root of a newly bean instance. A hollow element may
correspond to a singular or collective property.

    <subsection name='Frame Element'>
    	<p>
A frame element is present in the xml and is unbound to any
