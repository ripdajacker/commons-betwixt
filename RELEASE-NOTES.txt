			 Commons Betwixt Package
			   Version 1.0-Alpha-1
			    Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This is the first release for betwixt. Betwixt provides a flexible way to map beans into XML - and vice versa. 

There's quite a lot of work to be done before Betwixt is ready for a full release - but it's already used by other projects. This alpha will give a versioned release for these projects to depend on. A word of warning - though the developers take backwards compatible very seriously, it's likely that some parts of the internal API are going to have to change - and some of these changes may break compatibility. Obviously, these changes will be kept to a minimum.

NEW FEATURES:

Everything :)

But here's some features you might like to take a look at:

* Betwixt can write beans to character streams or as SAX events
* Betwixt builds on Digester (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/digester.html) to allow xml to be read (using SAX) and mapping into beans in a compatible way
* Betwixt supports powerful pluggable general strategies but also allows mappings to be customized at the bean level.


BUG FIXES:
