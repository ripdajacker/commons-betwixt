                              Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

Betwixt provides a flexible way to map beans into XML - and vice versa.

Betwixt 0.6.1 is a feature release. A number of new strategies have been 
introduced to add flexibility. Improvements have been made to binding and 
introspection including improved support for polymophism. Improvements have 
been made to the dot betwixt file format including support for multiple 
specifications within the same file.

Betwixt 0.6.1 is binary compatible with 0.6 but a number of changes have been 
made to some semantics. It is believed that the impact of these changes should 
be minimal.
