			 Commons Betwixt Package
  			       Version 0.5
			      Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

Betwixt provides a flexible way to map beans into XML - and vice versa. This is the 
first betwixt release.

This release consolidates the codebase released in Alpha-1.0. It is stable and mature
but the design is limited. Newer, more sophisticated designs are being introduced 
(in later releses) but they are unlikely to be binary compatible. This API exposed 
in this release is therefore not sufficiently stable enough to warrent a 1.0 version 
number.
