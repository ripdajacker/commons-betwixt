                              Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

Betwixt provides a flexible way to map beans into XML - and vice versa.

Betwixt release 0.6 is the first release containing the refactored codebase 
featuring an improved design. This is a service release for those who have been
using the code from the CVS branch and offers an easy, compatible upgrade path
for those using the 0.5 design. It is recommended that all users should upgrade
to this release since the 0.5 design is no longer actively supported and is 
limited in terms of functionality. 

This release is binary compatible with the 0.5 codebase but the methods deprecated
in 0.5 are likely to be removed soon after 0.6 is released.

For more details see the tasks document.
